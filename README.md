# Jack Compiler
Jack Programming Language Compiler written purely in C++, does not follow most of the compiler thoery and is therefore extremely complicated.
The purpose of the project was for me to have fun and build something functional, it does not therefore return errors in most cases, is not efficient, does not follow any guidelines, it's freestyle code and should not be used by anyone to do real compilation. There are other compilers which follow compiler thoery and can do that much more efficiently.

It passes all the test given in the Nand2Tetris course and can theoritically compile any piece of jack code.
